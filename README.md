Library Management Systems are used to manage information about contents in a library. They are used to manage information relating to books, their names, codes, author names, whether they have been issued or not and if so, who has issued them and what their card’s ID is; a  library management system is used to store and manage all this information.

The objective of this is to create a GUI based  Library Management System. To build this, you will need intermediate understanding of the SQLite API and its commands, intermediate understanding of  Tkinter  library, Ttk module’s Treeview, and basic understanding of messagebox module.
